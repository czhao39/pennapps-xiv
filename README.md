# Homie - Your Best Friend in Home Buying
### Susanna Bradbury, Eric Wang, and Charles Zhao

Home buying is often a difficult process and a lack of information is one of its greatest hurdles. Home buyers are busy enough, so we wanted to make their lives a bit easier. Homie consolidates information from many different sources into a simple interface. Users can find information both about the property and about the surrounding area, including parks, emergency services, schools, and much more.
